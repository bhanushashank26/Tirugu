Tirugu - 360 Product Image Viewer
Overview
Tirugu is an open-source software designed to provide a seamless and interactive way to view 360-degree product images. It supports features like zooming, panning, and rotating product images, offering an enhanced user experience for marketing, e-commerce, and product presentation.

Development Process
This software was entirely coded with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant.

Concept and Idea: The idea, project design, and intended features were fully conceived by me.
Code Generation: Every line of code in this project was generated by GitHub Copilot. I reviewed, guided, and tested the suggestions made by Copilot to ensure the final product met my vision.
Why Open Source?
I decided to share this project as open-source software for the following reasons:

To contribute to the developer community by providing a useful tool.
To comply with GitHub Copilot's licensing requirements and demonstrate ethical usage of the tool.
To inspire others to explore how tools like GitHub Copilot can assist in building innovative software.
A Note on Simplicity and Future Improvements
This project is my first venture into software development, and its current design focuses on basic functionality rather than aesthetics. While the interface is simple and visually minimalistic, it serves as a strong foundation for future upgrades.

I am committed to enhancing and evolving this project over time. Contributions from the community are not just welcome but greatly appreciated. Whether you're refining the visuals, adding new features, or improving the performance, your input is valuable. Thank you in advance for helping make Tirugu even better!
